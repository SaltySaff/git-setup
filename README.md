This script is designed to automate the process of creating a new project directory on Linux, initializing it with a basic HTML, CSS, and JS file stucture, and creating a new repository on GitHub with the same name as the project directory.

## Prerequisites
To run this script, you need to have the following installed on your system:
- Git
- GitHub CLI ('gh')

## Usage
To use this script, follow these steps:
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create a new project directory.
2. Run the script by entering the executing the git-setup.sh file, and enter a name for the project.
3. The script will create a new directory with the specified name, and populate it with 'index.html' (including boilerplate code), 'style.css', and 'script.js' files. A blank README.md file will also be created.
4. The script will initialize the new directory as a Git repository and create a new repository on GitHub with the same name as the project directory.
